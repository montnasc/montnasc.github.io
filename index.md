Welcome — I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Institute of Sustainable Chemistry at Leuphana University Lüneburg. I hold a PhD in Physics Education from the Federal University of Rio Grande Do Sul (UFRGS) in Brazil, and was a Professor in their Physics Department prior to my current leave. The central focus of my research is on equity, diversity, and identity in Science Education.
