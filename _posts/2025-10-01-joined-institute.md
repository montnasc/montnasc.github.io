I'm excited to announce that I have joined the **Institute of Sustainable Chemistry** at **Leuphana University Lüneburg** as a Postdoctoral Research Associate, working with Prof. Simone Abels.

In this new role, I will be investigating the intersection of equity, diversity, and identity in science education within the context of sustainable chemistry. This position allows me to expand my research on structural inequalities in science learning environments to the specific challenges and opportunities in chemistry education.

Leuphana's strong focus on sustainability and interdisciplinary research provides an excellent environment to explore how science education can contribute to more equitable and sustainable futures.

*Looking forward to this new chapter!*
