I am thrilled to announce that after Munich, I will be heading to Turkey for a second visiting scholarship.

From December to March, I will be based in Ankara as a Visiting Scholar at Hacettepe University, working with Professor Gultekin Cakmakci. I'm excited to spend three months diving into a new research environment and culture.

This opportunity is also funded by my CAPES-Print grant, and I am looking forward to expanding my research network in Turkey.
