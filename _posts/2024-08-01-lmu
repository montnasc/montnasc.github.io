I am excited to announce that between August and December 2024, I will be joining the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU) in Munich as a Visiting Scholar. During this time, I will have the privilege of collaborating with Professor Silvija Markic.

This research visit is made possible by a grant from the CAPES-Print program (Institutional Internationalization Program). I am deeply grateful for this opportunity to engage with the research community at LMU and look forward to the academic exchanges and insights this experience will bring.
