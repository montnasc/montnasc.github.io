Our paper **"The iceberg of science identity: structural inequalities in science-related practices and dispositions"** has been published in the *International Journal of Science Education*.

**Abstract:** This study theorizes the hidden structural factors that constrain the formation of a science identity, moving beyond individual attributes to systemic dispositions and practices. We propose a framework that highlights how inequalities in science-related practices and dispositions create barriers to science identity development, particularly for students from underrepresented groups.

**Key findings:**
- Science identity formation is constrained by structural inequalities
- Dispositions toward science are shaped by social and cultural capital
- Institutional practices often reinforce existing disparities
