*Becoming a Scientist: Identity, Privilege and Barriers*

Tags: Gender Diversity Certificate

Content and concept: This seminar explores the concept of science identity and its role in shaping who is seen—and sees themselves—as a “science person.” Drawing on research in science education, we will examine how social, cultural, and institutional factors contribute to the inclusion or exclusion of individuals in scientific communities. Discussions will focus on the intersection of identity with dimensions such as gender, race, and socioeconomic background, analyzing how privilege and systemic barriers influence science participation. Through critical engagement with academic literature and case studies, students will reflect on their own experiences and investigate strategies to foster more inclusive scientific environments.

Objective:
- Examine how science identity is constructed and negotiated within educational and professional contexts.
- Analyze the role of privilege, representation, and systemic barriers in shaping science participation.
- Explore intersections between science identity and broader issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion.
- Develop critical perspectives on how science education and institutions can support more inclusive identities in science.


*Social justice and education: Challenges and possibilities*

Tags: Profile study inclusion and diversity

Content and concept: This seminar examines the relationship between education and social justice through the lens of Pierre Bourdieu’s sociological theories. We will explore how educational systems can both reproduce and challenge social inequalities, considering concepts such as habitus, capital, and field. Key topics include the role of economic, cultural and social capital in educational success, systemic barriers to equity, and the potential of education as a tool for social transformation. Through research-based learning, students will engage with academic literature, analyze empirical studies, and reflect on contemporary educational policies and practices.

Objective:
- Develop a critical understanding of social justice in education from a sociological perspective.
- Introduce key theoretical concepts and their implications for educational equity.
- Analyze how schools and universities contribute to the reproduction or transformation of social inequalities.
- Engage in research-based learning, applying theoretical insights to real-world educational challenges.
